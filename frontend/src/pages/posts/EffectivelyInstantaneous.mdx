Here's a list of things your computer can do in under 16.67ms :

In the year 2022 theres no reason why a simple webpage should take much longer than that to load on good hardware with a good connection.

The technologies I use in this website to achieve that are :  

<Image src='../../images/astroflamethrower.png' maxwidth='400px'></Image>

1. Astro - a super lightweight framework that prerenders everything at build time and boasts intercompatibility with every other major framework.
2. Flamethrower - a client side router that pre fetches visible links and intercepts page transitions to convert a multi page app to a single page one. 

That's all, just 2 pieces of software for my front end. Astro can also handle api endpoints so I could deploy on Netlify and use SSR 
and be done. The flexibility afforded by that simplicity has advantages too - 

- I could write a simple server with Axum.rs, integrate Postgres into it with Diesel, and deploy the whole thing on Linode as a static site, if I needed to 
make a website like Wikipedia or the Internet Archive, which just need to serve a huge amount of static pages efficiently. 
- I could target a microprocessor and write a simple static file server in C using the Arduino libraries and just serve up the compiled build folder, which, minus the images, is only 11KB.
With the (unoptimized) images its 856KB. That's small enough to be viable for even embedded devices like the esp32, which have wifi compatibility but less than 4MB of onboard storage. 

## When To Consider Flamethrower + Astro

The argument could be made for many websites that it doesn't make economic sense for them to make their service so responsive - prefetching the amount of links present 
in a Wikipedia article would blow up their server bandwidth dozens of times over.

Fortunately though Flamethrower offers you the option to only prefetch links when the user starts hovering over them - the
body swap done in js is much faster and more responsive than an entire page load, and it preserves state between pages. 

## Setup Instructions

The project setup using this stack with rust is as follows (skip to step 5 if you don't care about Rust): 

1. make a git repo with rust gitignore
2. open with vs code
3. initialize new rust project by typing the following in the terminal : cargo new 
4. copy paste the cargo.toml below 
5. make a new folder in project root beside src, make astro project following instructions on their [github](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/)
6. if you want to use svelte : npx astro add svelte
7. npm i flamethrower-router
8. go to layout.astro and add the import lines to the layout.astro file's head.
```javascript
    <script>
        import flamethrower from 'flamethrower-router';
        flamethrower({ prefetch: 'visible', log: true, pageTransitions: false });
    </script>
```

For an example file based router if you're going the pure static site generator route with astro, look at [this example](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/blob/main/examples/static-file-server/src/main.rs)

Cargo.toml 
```toml
[package]
name = "axum-sandbox"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
axum = "0.5.16"
tokio = {version="1.0", features=["full"]}
serde = "1.0.145"
axum-extra = {version="0.3.7" , features=["spa"]}
tower-http = {version="0.3.0" , features=["fs" , "trace"]}
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-subscriber = {version="0.3", features=["env-filter"]}
```

And voila, you've got a static site that should be as fast as it possibly can be. You don't have dynamic routes with this, unless you can figure out
how to make Astro generate a page from Rust.
