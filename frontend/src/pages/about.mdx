My name is Daniel Gutierrez, and this is my personal blog.  

I'm a software engineer that values performance and enjoys teaching with a wide range of technical experience.  
This blog was made with Astro and Flamethrower.js and deployed on Netlify, and may be upgraded to a server written with Axum.rs and deployed on Linode in the near future. 

### Experience
I've done the following in a professional capacity

- Electrical Engineering, designing market ready PCBs on EasyEDA to extend the functionality of the ESP32 
microprocessor to interface with Lego hardware and safely manage an internal LiPo (effectively competing with their $300 Mindstorm for $15),
- Embedded Software, using micropython to create a tiny webserver and website that allowed remote block based programming of the ESP32, 
- Python Programming, writting robotics libraries for internal use that implement inverse kinematics as 
well as interface with a variety of hardware such as encoders, servos, and sonar,
- Computer Graphics and Javascript Programming, creating a few dozen interactive mathematical and physics [examples](https://editor.p5js.org/Daniel-A-Gutierrez/sketches) using p5.js for a generative art and math curriculum I created,
- Data Science, analyzing an RNASeq dataset using R to identify candidate genes of interest for the Wood Lab at UCI,
- Rust Programming, creating an interpreter for a mock assembly language in Rust,
- Game Development, teaching a VR/AR and multiplayer game development using Unity in 2019,
- Full Stack Web Development, rewriting [windtreeeducation.org](http://www.windtreeeducation.org) to use vanilla js / css + webcomponents instead of wordpress, and a netlify host instead of network solutions, improving page loads from ~15s to around ~1s. The new site also has dynamic pages for each school to register for classes, instead of requiring a new webpage and form for each school, and all the content is managed from a google sheet for ease of use.

And just for fun I have
- Solved the [hardest problem on codewars.com available in Rust](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5985ea20695be6079e000003). It was uploaded in 2017 and when I completed it in August 2022, I was the 13th person to do so in Rust, and 212th overall, with over 9000 others attempting it. My code is visible [here](https://github.com/Daniel-A-Gutierrez/rust_sandbox/blob/master/src/experiments/refactored_nqueens.rs) - article coming soon!
- Created around a dozen almost decent games that net me over $.50 ! I'm not linking them.

### What Am I Up To?

11/6/2022 : I've settled on Astro as a framework. I tried React and Svelte - hated React, Svelte was cool, but Astro is just better for the types of websites
I'm trying to make right now. Also I did some database tutorials. MongoDB is cool, I like Postgres a lot. I think I'm going to try learning 
Flamethrower.js + Astro + Axum + Postgres. Also, planned the Hawaii trip last night!

10/14/2022 : Got carpal tunnel in both my wrists so I've taken a few weeks off of gaming/programming.
